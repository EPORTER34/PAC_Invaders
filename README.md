# PAC_Invaders (CPT_S 122 PA 9)
Have you ever found yourself despising former PAC12 teams. Do you just wish that you had a way to express your frustrations over the dissolution of such a gorgeous conference. Well there is now a solution to your dilemma.

Introducing PAC Invaders, a game in which you can take up arms as Washington State University against the traitorous programs that so tragically abandoned us.

Made by Eric Porter, Ezhoc Chavez, Ethan Karasha, & Clancy Copinger, all from the prestigious lab section 7, PAC Invaders is a game in which one maneuvers a WSU logo (left & right arrows) across the screen and fires footballs with the (up arrow) at waves of former PAC 12 opponents. But watch out, they fire back as well, and if they hit you enough times, you will be redered unable to continue defending the remainder of the storied conference.
