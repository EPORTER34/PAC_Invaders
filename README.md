# PAC_Invaders (CPT_S 122 PA 9)
Have you ever found yourself despising former PAC12 teams. Do you just wish that you had a way to express your frustrations over the dissolution of such a gorgeous conference. Well there is now a solution to your dilemma.

Introducing PAC Invaders, a game in which you can take up arms as Washington State University against the traitorous programs that so tragically abandoned us.

Made by Eric Porter, Ehzoc Chavez, Ethan Karasha, & Clancy Coppinger, all from the prestigious lab section 7, PAC Invaders is a game in which one maneuvers a WSU logo (left & right arrows) across the screen and fires footballs with the (up arrow) at waves of former PAC 12 opponents. But watch out, they fire back as well, and if they hit you enough times, you will be rendered unable to continue defending the remainder of the storied conference.

Polymorphism wasn't used on the project since it was not necessary, since there are only three object classes, there wasn't much room to begin with on using having unique attributes for each class. There is some inheritance with the character class where the similar health attribute is shared between the enemy and player classes, but they aren't using similar methods for the most part on the various new functions in each class. The closest that it gets is using the fireFootballs function, but since there's only 1 different number it isn't really different enough to be considered an implementation of polymorphism.
